		  <p>Apply as a freshman if you are currently in high school (regardless of total college credits completed while in high school) or you have graduated from high school but haven’t enrolled at a college, university or any other school after high school.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This includes early/middle college students who complete a high school diploma at the same time as an associate’s degree. Students who are not permanent residents should see the international applicants section. </p>

This same college reviews the application and determines the final admission decision. <a href="http://www.bryantsmith.com">BryantSmith.com</a> to get it.</p>
